        <p>
            Howdy! I am a Senior Service Missionary working with BYU<br>
            Pathway Connect. I became a student primarily to assist the<br>
            students I work with better. I also wanted to modernize my computer<br>
            programming skills. I started programing computers in 1965 using<br>
            FORTRAN. Since then I have written programs in BASIC, COBOL, <br>
            Visual BASIC and HTML. However, it has been quite a few years <br>
            since I have done any programming, so I have a lot to learn. <br>
            I am anxious to see what lies ahead.
