            Howdy! I am a Senior Service Missionary working with BYU Pathway Connect. I became a student primarily to assist the students I work with better. I also wanted to modernize my computer programming skills. I started programing computers in 1965 using FORTRAN. Since then I have written programs in BASIC, COBOL, Visual BASIC and HTML. However, it has been quite a few years since I have done any programming, so I have a lot to learn. I am anxious to see what lies ahead.

            Wyoming was the 44th state to be admitted to the United States on July 10, 1890. However, it was the first state to grant women the right to vote. Although it is the 10th largest in area, it is the smallest in population with slightly more than 500,000 people. Wyoming is famous for its national parks including Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and for its abundance of outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, skiing, hiking, and mountain climbing.
