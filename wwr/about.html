                Floating down a river in a river tube is a great way to cool off on a hot summer day! Go with the flow of the water and ride your tube down the river while taking in the beautiful scenery of trees, shrubbery and flowers and scenic river boulders. River tubing is ideal in the months of May through September. Just put your lifejacket and slide your tube into the cool water and enjoy a leisurely float or some exciting rapids.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>It all started when I fell out of a raft while on a white water rafting trip. The rapids were wild enough that I was unable to get back into the raft. So, I finished the trip floating on my life jacket. Although a bit scary at first, as I got used to the experience, it became a little bit challenging, but a whole bunch of fun. </p>

            <p>I thought, who needs an expensive raft? It might be just as fun on an innertube. Well, it turns out that I was absolutely right. River tubing is unexpetedly enjoyable, less complicated and far less expensive than river rafting. That was nearly 25 years ago. We have been promoting river tubing ever since.</p>
